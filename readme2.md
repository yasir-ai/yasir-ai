## 🔍 What This Is

This is my personal lab — not school projects, not fake builds.  
Everything here is built, broken, debugged, documented, and tested like it's production.

**Key themes:**  
`systems` · `security` · `automation` · `readiness`

## 📓 How I Work

> *"Everything gets logged. Because every fix is repeatable."*

- ✅ Every project has a *why*, a *how*, and a *fix*  
- ✅ Every config, script, and command is saved  
- ✅ Every tool used is explained  

Think of this as my **internal playbook**, made public.

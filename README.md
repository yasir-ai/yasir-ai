# Hi, I'm Yasir! Glad to have you in my research lab.

First of all, I must state: this isn’t a portfolio.  
This is where I test ideas, break things on purpose, and solve problems like they’re real - because they eventually will be.

## ⭐ Featured Project:
- [Ultimate SOPs for The 3 Most Common IT Incidents](https://github.com/yasir-ai/SuperSOPs/tree/main#stakeholder-communication-templates)
- [AutoDoc API: Edit DocX Files Using JSON](https://github.com/yasir-ai/AutoDoc-API)

## 🔬 What This Is

You’re looking at my lab. Not coursework. Not fake projects. Just real systems, simulated attacks, broken configs, and cold documentation.

I love making live builds, ticket resolutions, network configs, and defense focused workflows.

The goal is to reflect real ops thinking -> so systems + security + automation + speed.

Everything here has a *why*, a *how*, and a *fix*.

## 📓 How I Work

- Everything is logged. Because every fix is repeatable.
- Every project is documented like a case study
- Every config, script, and command is stored for future use.

Call it a playbook. Call it prep. I call it **readiness**.



## 📫 Let’s Talk If You...

- Want someone who’s training like they’re on the job already
- Need an IT pro who doesn’t just know commands — but knows **why** they matter
- Prefer documentation over excuses
- Want to work on a project together
